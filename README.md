### hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Nadilla**, a Full-Stack Website Developer from Cikarang, Indonesia.

I'm primarily interested in remote **Full-Stack Web Development** job and currently work as a
Barista at [**Navigasi Coffee**](https://www.instagram.com/navigasicoffee). 

ðŸ“Œ Previously, I was a Computer Science student at [**Pasundan University**](https://edurank.org/uni/pasundan-university) back in 2021.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high impact industries and am willing to be paid less for flexible remote work. I have contributed to the development of diverse platforms, including educational websites, e-commerce stores, and creating impactful user experiences and seamless functionality.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also read a lot of books, play instruments, and loves to learn new things.
